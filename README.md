## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Luara Kelly, I am currently interested in all things JavaScript & Full-Stack!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TrailPulse, building an outdoors sports track for android mobile app.
- âš¡ I recently configurated Home Assistant OS to integrate relays and automate the energy consumption of appliances by scheduling them during the cheapest hours.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about local hosted MBtiles & @maplibre.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or anything related to Full-Stack development, JavaScript, and smart home automation.
